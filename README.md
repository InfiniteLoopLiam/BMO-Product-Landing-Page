# BMO Product Landing Page

## Scope<br/>
To practice responsive web design and showcase newly learnt skills in flexbox, grid layouts and media queries.

## Introduction<br/>
Welcome to my product landing page for BMO! BMO, short for “Be More,” is a delightful character from Adventure Time—a sentient video game console with a personality. 
In this project, I’ve used both flexbox, CSS grid and a dash of media queries to design an engaging landing page that captures BMO’s playful spirit.

## Features<br/>
### Responsive Design<br/>
The page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Flexbox and grid layouts play a crucial role in achieving this responsiveness.
### Embedded video<br/>
Using a short embedded video animation of the disassembly of BMO adds a layer of realism and showcases intricacy to a product
### Webpage Showcase<br/>
I have designed the navbar to always be at the top of the webpage. This prompted me to use a top margin for the .grid-header element so that the navbar did not overlap any of it's content. I chose to use the flexbox method for the navbar as I believed it to be easier to achieve an even spacing between the navbar list elements that adjusts accordingly to screen and browser window width.
There are four grid layouts and some grid layouts have another nested grid layout. These sections are the header section that you first see when the page loads, "Features", "FAQ" and "Pricing" sections of the webpage.
### Styling<br/>
I wanted to use BMOs colour palette and a less sharp font styling to appeal to those who are creative and/or imaginative. I sourced all fonts from google fonts. 
I intend to work on the styling to be less jarring. The first issue I encountered was trying to blend the image background colour of the header image to the background color of the element itself. 

## Technologies Used<br/>
HTML5<br/>
CSS

## Usage<br/>
Feel free to explore the page, admire BMO’s many qualities, and maybe make some suggestions :).
